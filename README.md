# TFRecord_CalTech_Pedestrian_Dataset
Creating tfrecord for a big dataset when it can not be kept in Memory for processing
Files with data_Prep are used to create pickle files before creating the TFRecord for data set. The file with name tfrecord_read_write is used to create tfrecord. This code source is changed based on my need in a project, so it might not be applicable in your project, unless you change it as you like.

In case you need to ask question, I will be available to help and don't hesitate.
